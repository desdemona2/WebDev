# HTTP Networking

HTTP is a very common communication protocol. This is a simple protocol where client request for something and server response to that request. 

When we enter a url, we request server for a webpage hosted on that server. Server in response gives us back website structure as response (html, css, js).

A server can also act as a client in some cases. For e.g. think of a video streaming app like youtube, it has 2 servers, one with videos and other with comments linked with videos. When client makes a request for video and comments, the video server send a request for comments to comment server. In this case video server is acting as client but also as server as it is sending a response to client which made video request to it.



## Fetch API

Fetch is a library which can be used to make requests to servers.

```javascript
const response = await fetch(url, settings);
const responseData = await response.json();
```



## Getting IP Address using cloudflare api

```javascript
function getIP(domain) {
	const resp = await fetch(
        `https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query?name=${domain}&type=A`, 
    {
    	headers: {
      		'accept': 'application/dns-json'
    			}
  	})
    
    // You should makes some checks before returning
    // the ip addr otherwise it may cause some errors.
    return resp.Answer[0].data;
}
```



## URL API

```javascript
// extracting hostname from url
const url = "https://www.google.com/path/to/somewhere"
const urlObj = new URL(url);
const hostname = urlObj.hostname;

// get username
const username = urlObj.username.
```

`http://testuser:testpass@testdomain.com:8080/testpath?testsearch=testvalue#testhash` This is a url with different sections. Here is a breakdown of different sections of this url. And these keys on left can be used to fetch the data from url like for pathname we can use `urlObj.pathname`.

```json
protocol: http:
username: testuser
password: testpass
hostname: testdomain.com
port: 8080
pathname: /testpath
search: ?testsearch=testvalue
hash: #testhash
```

Few other methods:

```javascript
const myUrl = new URL("www.google.com/q?something+is+not+bad");

// to get the params or url
myUrl.searchParams;

// append a new search param
myUrl.searchParams.append('key', 'value');
```
