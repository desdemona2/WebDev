# CSS

Cascade Sheet Styling is a way to beautify a website. There are few ways using which one can add css to html code:-

1. **Inline CSS**: `style` attribute is used for every html attribute to control it's asthetics
2. **Internal CSS**: `style` tag is used in website to control elements present in the website
3. **External CSS**: External css code file is used and linked to current page to control asthetics of webpage.

Properties in css will stay same but we can use them differently by using **inline, internal or external css**.

CSS has a syntax that looks something like **selector {property: value;}**.

### Common CSS Properties

- To get **all css properties** one can go on [this mdn's page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference). Here we will find all the css properties we will be using for our website. 

- `background-color`: This can be used to set background color of any html element to a particular value.

  - ```css
    body {
        background-color: "blue";
    }
    ```

- **[colorhunt](https://colorhunt.co/) is a website where one can get ideas for website backgrounds.**

- `height` can be used to set height of a particular element.

- `width` can be used to set width of a particular element.

- `overflow` is used to set behaviour when content of a particular element goes outside element. It can have values like `visible, hidden, scroll, auto`

- `color` property is used to set color of a particular element i.e. **h1, textfield, p etc**.

  - ```css
    h1, p {
        color: blue;
    }
    ```

- `font-family` is the property to set font for the particular element. It is recommened to put multiple values as per priority to ensure maximum compatibility.

  - ```css
    p {
      font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;
    }
    ```

- `margin` or `padding` is used to set the margin or padding of an element. One can also set padding or margin for specific postion like `margin-left, margin-right, margin-top, margin-bottom`.

- `letter-spacing` to set spacing in letters.



### Priority Order for CSS Styles

There are 3 ways CSS can be applied on a webpage. `inline, internal, external`. Inline is prioritized over internal and external. **Internal is prioritized more than external**.



### Horizontal Rule Styling

`<hr>` tag can be used to create a horizontal line between content in website. For some html elements browsers uses some default styling properties which can be looked [here](https://www.w3schools.com/csSref/css_default_values.php#:~:text=display%3A%20block%3B-,hr,-display%3A%20block%3B). `border-style` or `border`can be used to set the style of border. It can take upto 3 values.

1. **Thickness of border line** i.e. 2px, 2rem, 2mm etc.
2. Border type i.e. **solid, double, block(default), inset, ridge etc.**
3. **color of the border line.** 

```css
hr {
    /* border can also be specified as below
	border: 4px solid lightblue;
    */
    border: none;
    border-top: 5px double rgba(10,10,10,0.6);
    color: rbg(256, 256, 256);
    overflow: visible;
    text-align: center;
    height: 0px;
}
```

One can also use `border-style` property to set unique boundry for each side. i.e.

```css
/* top | right | bottom | left */
border-style: none solid dotted dashed;
/* to align h. rule to left we have to set left-margin to 0 */
margin-left: 0;
```



### Universal Selectors

Universal selector is a selector which takes every element into it's effects

```css
* {
    color: "red";
}
```

### Type Selectors

Type selectors are selectors which selects elements of similar type and effect those.

```css
p {
    background-color: lightblue;
    color: black;
}
```

### Class Selectors

In Internal or external CSS we can use class selectors to specify a particular element. Suppose we have two `h1` tags and we want one to be blue and other to be red, than we can't simply add tag selector and set property to red as it will make other tag red too. So for such case scenarios we use class selectors. A class selector is used to specify a tag in external CSS file. For that we need to specify a **class name** for the tag itself.

```html
<h1 class="head1">My First Heading</h1>
<h1 class="head2">My Second Heading</h1>
```

```css
.head1 {
    color: "red";
}

.head2 {
    color: "blue";
}
```

A single element in html code can be given more than one class, and by using that every class can handle different purposes. Suppose we have 2 `<img>` tags, in one we want to have **background-color** red and in another we want blue. But we want both to be circular. Than we can create 3 different class selectors, 2 for background-color and 1 for circular shape.

```html
<img href="images/image1" class="image1 circle">
<img href="images/image2" class="image2 circle">
```

```css
.image1 {
    background-color: "red";
}

.image2 {
    background-color: "blue";
}

.circular {
    border-radius: "100%";
}
```

### ID Selectors

These are selectors which are similar to classes but not 2 elements on a single page can have same id. Id for a single element is specified by using `id` attribute. i.e. `<img href="./images/java.png" id="java">`.

```css
#java {
    background-color: "blue";
}
```

**Unlike classes a single element can't have multiple id's**. Use of ID's is not very common practise and is not recommended by developers.

### Group Selectors

These selectors are used to select a group of elements and apply same properties to those. Those individual groups may have their own properties also.

```css
/* similar properties in group selectors */
.read, .math {
    color: white;
    background-color: lightblack;
}
/* different properties in class selectors */
.read {
    border: 2px solid red;
}

.math {
    border-radius: 0.2rem;
}
```

### Chaining Selectors

```html
<div>
  <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
</div>
```

We have two elements with the `subsection` class that have some sort of unique styles, but what if we only want to apply a separate rule to the element that also has `header` as a second class? Well, we could chain both the class selectors together in our CSS like so:

```css
.subsection.header {
  color: red;
}

.subsection {
    background-color: white;
}

.header {
    background-color: black;
}
```

### Descendant Selectors

something like `.ancestor .child` would select an element with the class `child` if it has an ancestor with the class `ancestor`. Another way to think of it is `child` will only be selected if it is nested inside of `ancestor`, no matter how deep.

```html
<div class="ancestor"> <!-- A -->
  <div class="contents"> <!-- B -->
    <div class="contents"> <!-- C -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="contents"></div> <!-- D -->
```

```css
.ancestor .contents {
  /* some declarations */
}
```

#### Miscelleneous:

        </tr>


### Centring Parent's Content

1. Child element is block element.
2. Child element has a width value set.

If child doesn't have a width value set, than in parent we can set it's **`text-align`** property to `center`. To bring all the child elements to center.

The **`text-align`** [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the horizontal alignment of the inline-level content inside a block element or table-cell box.

If child does have a width value, than setting `text-align` in parent won't help. In that case we need to set **`margin` property of child** to have a value of `auto`. `auto` can set the element horizontally and vertically centered.

```css
.myClass {
    /* margin: top right bottom left  (vertical horizontal will also works)*/
    margin: 0 auto;
}
```





### Favicons

Favicons are also knows as favorite icons and are the little icons that show at the beginning of title of the tab. [This website](https://www.favicon.cc/) creates cool looking favicons. 

1. Download the favicon and place it in the project directory.
2. **Link to the icon in the head section using `<link>` and setting  type to `icon`**.
   - `<link rel="icon" href="./Images/favicon.ico" />`
   - In case browser is not showing the new favicon you applied, there is a slight possibility that it has cached the previous version of favicon. So to fix this use `<link rel="icon" href="./Images/favicon.ico?v=2" />`.

### Display

1. Block
2. Inline
3. Inline-Block
4. None

##### Block

Block elements are ones which take whole horizontal space preventing any another element to sit along with it. Some common block elements are `<p>, <h[1,6]>, <div>, <form>, <ol>, <ul>, <li>`.

##### Inline

Inline elements are ones which take space only amounting upto their need. `span` is a inline element. And can be used to give special properties to a part of heading or paragraphs.

```html
<p>I am a <span class="ClassBold">programmer</span></p>
```

```css
.classBold {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

Some common Inline elements are **`<span>, <img>, <a>`**.

**width** in inline elements are useless as they have flexible width, so setting width for most of Inline elements is useless. **width for img can be used unlike other inline elements**.

##### Inline-Block

These blocks are kind of hybrid of block and inline as their width can be adjusted and also they won't take up the entire row, leaving space for siblings

##### None

None can be used to remove the element from the screen by setting `display` property of that element to `none`.

### Position (Relative, absolute)

There are 3 rules in putting visual content on a website:-

1. Content decides dimensions of elements, i.e. height and even width in some cases(inline)
2. Order comes from code: things on screen will be in order as they are defined in html file.
3. Children sit on a parent.

**Position**:

1. static -> All elements are static by default.

2. relative -> Element is positioned according to it's static position or previous position

   - ```html
     <style>
         img {
             position: relative;
             top: 15px;
             bottom: 15px;
             left: 15px;
             right: 15px;
         }
     </style>
     <body>
         <img src="./Images/image.jpg" alt="image">
     </body>
     ```

3. absolute -> Elements in this type of positioning are positioned relative to their parents.

   - ```css
     <style>
         img {
             position: absolute;
             top: 15px;
             bottom: 15px;
             left: 15px;
             right: 15px;
         }
     </style>
     <body>
         <img src="./Images/image.jpg" alt="image">
     </body>
     ```

   - To set an element's absolute position to relative to something, we need to have a parent with **relative position** otherwise it will keep getting positioned according to body as relative parent.

4. fixed -> Elements with fixed position will stay at their position if we scroll the webpage.

   - ```css
     <style>
     img {
         position: absolute;
         top: 15px;
         bottom: 15px;
         left: 15px;
         right: 15px;
     }
     </style>
     <body>
     <img src="./Images/image.jpg" alt="image">
     </body>	
     ```

   

### Fonts

Fonts are important part of asthetics of a website and different fonts can also change the position of other elements on website. There will be possibility that specified font-family is not available on a particular system. In that case we need to add some fallback-fonts, so that one of them can be used to render the website. But 2 different fonts can make huge impact on website's asthetics, so we need to choose fallback fonts very carefully.

```css
h1 {
    font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;
}
```

- There is a [list of websafe fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.php) which can be used to avoid font failures in most cases.
- This a data showing [percentage of usage of fonts](https://www.cssfontstack.com/) which again can be used to choose fonts for websites with their fallback fonts.
- Website will try to render font's by order, so make sure to add those fonts as per priority.

**If we want website not to look different on different OS's because of fonts, we can embed fonts in website too.** One can choose font families from [google-fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and embed them to the website.

##### Static and dynamic font size:

For static font size we can simply set the `font-size` property to something particular like **16px**. But if we want the values to be dynamic than we can set the `font-size` as a percentage value or size with the unit `em` like **`font-size: 300% or font-size: 2em`**. 100% is same as 1em and both are equal to **16px**.

**Be careful while using dynamic sizes for fonts in website** as if font-size is already specified by a parent than the font-size set for the child will be applied with parent's specified font-size. So if body has specified font size of 200% and child has specified font size of 300% than resulting font will be 300% of the 200% means it will be 600%. This same principle applies for `em`.

**This can be avoided by using `rem` as size unit**. `rem` will ignore parent settings but set the font-size as per the root i.e. `font-size: 300rem`.

### Float and Clear

To put an image with some other element in a row.

```html
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/95/b7/e1/95b7e17b5161175de4fe88b1b2602236.png" alt="android image">
<p>This is an image of Android doodle.</p>
```

 ```css
 img {
     float: left;
 }
 ```

<img style="width: 20%; float:left;" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/95/b7/e1/95b7e17b5161175de4fe88b1b2602236.png" alt="android image"> 

<p>This is an image of Android doodle.</p>





As one can see it is floaing in the left and in the right of it, is a paragraph.

`clear` will clear left or right side of the element as specified. So if we had specified `clear: left` for paragraph it would have gone down to the android doodle image as it has to clear it's left side. 

### Transitions on Hover

```html
<button class="mybutton">
    Click Me!
</button>
```

```css
.mybutton {
    transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out;
}

.mybutton:hover {
    color: red;
    transform: scale(1.1);
}
```



### Rotate Elements

```css
.title-image {
    width: 60%;
    transform: rotate(20deg);
}
```



### Stack and Z-Axis

In browsers we don't have only 2 dimensions (x,y), we also have 3rd dimension, z-axis. By default children will stack on top of parent. We can change that order by setting `z-index` value for the element. Elements inside a single parent will be stacked in increasing order of their `z-index` value.

```html
<div>
  <div class="red">Red</div>
  <div class="blue">Blue</div>
  <div class="yellow">Yellow</div>
</div>
```



css properties:

 ```css
 div {
   height: 100px;
   width: 100px;
   position: absolute;
 }
 
 .red {
   background-color: red;
 }
 
 .blue {
   background-color: blue;
   left: 10px;
   top: 10px;
 }
 
 .yellow {
   background-color: yellow;
   left: 20px;
   top: 20px;
 }
 ```

if we set `z-index` value of yellow to -1 it will be stacked at bottom of hierarchy and blue will come on top.

In a situation where red, yellow and blue has `z-index` value of 3,1,2 respectively, order will be `red, yellow, blue`. **One thing to keep in mind is that stacking or z-index value will only work for elements which has a position property other than default (static). 



### Media Query Breakpoints

Media queries can be used for different purposes like if screen size is smaller than a particular value than follow certain query or if page is being printed use different media query etc. These queries can be used to follow certain design patterns to follow under certain conditions.

Standard format for a media query is `@media <type> <feature>`

type can have values like screen, print, all (means will work on all queries like screen and print)

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 1045px) {
  .content-left {
    width: unset;
    margin: 10px 5%;
  }
  .content-right {
    width: unset;
  }
}
```

Above is a media query which will unset the width value for some class and set the margin value to `10px 5%` when screen size is less than 1045px.

```css
h1 {
    color: black;
    font-size: 20px;
}

@media (max-width: 1000px) and (min-width: 900px) {
    h1 {
        color: red;
        font-size: 24px;
    }
}
```

In above query we have combined 2 queries to target a specific viewport i.e. Screen with size between 900px and 1000px.

```css
@media (max-width: 500px) and (orientation: landscape) {
    h1 {
        color: red;
        line-height: 0.2rem;
        letter-spacing: 0.01rem;
    }
}
```

`and` keyword can be used to connect all media queries at once. But we can also use or but instead of keyword `or` we need to use `,` in between them i.e.

```css
@media (max-width: 500px), (orientation: portrait) {
    h1 {
        font-size: 4rem;
    }
}

@media screen and (min-aspect-ratio: 1/1) {
    /* Do something */
}
```



### Setting nth child

This will set the font-size of 2nd list item (World) to 1.5rem;

```html
<ul class="list">
    <li>Hello</li>
    <li>World</li>
    <li>! </li>
</ul>
```

```css
.list:nth-child(2) {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
}
```



### Flex Box

Flexbox is used to set elements in html. Flexbox gives you too much freedom to do things inluding the famous one of aligning items vertically. 

For flexbox to work we need to set parent's display property to flex. `display: flex`. By setting display of parent to flex it will set all it's children as flex-items and now if they were block elements before they will act kinda like `inline` elements but not completely like inline.

`flex-wrap` is another property which can be used to wrap the items in flex container to wrap items. There is a [nice video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u044iM9xsWU) about how flexbox works.

`flex-direction` can be used on parent to set children in horizontal or vertical direction. It's value can be `row` or `column`. There are 2 axis in flexbox `mainaxis` and `crossaxis`.



Best thing about flexbox is that children have more control over their position than parent which makes things more customizable. `flex-shrink, flex-grow, flex-basis` properties will decide how much item will shrink, grow and item-size at start. These all values can be set using simple `flex` property. It is a shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `flex-basis`. Default `flex-basis` is auto, so all items will not be treated equally by flexbox. The item with longest content (horizontally) will be given more width in flexbox (on the basis of percentage). `flex-basis` is not width but it's alot like width. When set to auto it will automatically calculate size for each item. 

There are properties like `min-content` and `max-content` which can be helpful to understand flexbox.

`justify-content` will be used to set content in main-axis. It has values like `center, space-around, space-between, space-evenly, flex-start, flex-end`.

`align-items` will be used to set the content on cross-axis. It has values like `center, stretch, flex-start, flex-end`

`align-self` can be used to set the element on cross-axis. Unlike `align-items` or `justify-content` it will be work on children and it's values will be same as `align-items`.

### Outline

Outline is similar to border only difference being it doesn't contribute to dimensions of the elements.

```css
.list {
    outline: 4px solid red;
}
```
