# EJS

Till now we are only sending static webpages as a response of a get request. If we keep doing it we will have to create same webpage again and again for same thing. If we are creating a blog website we have to make different html file for different blogs even though they all have very similar structure.

Then comes the concept of templates. We use EJS to create templates for html, which will be converted to html code by using `app.render` method.

ejs is also a kind of html file but like `formated strings` we can have variables inside that html code, which we can change later to some other value in our javascript file.

```ejs
<h1><%= myHeading %></h1>
<p><%= myParagraph %></p>
```

Now to use this in our server file we can use `app.render` method instead of `app.send`.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = require('app');

// setting view engine to ejs
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

const heading = getHeading();
const paragraph = getParagraph();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    app.render('files', {myHeading: heading, myParagraph: paragraph});
});
```

**But remember when we specify a file in render method it will try to find it in views directory, so make sure to keep your ejs files in ejs directory**.

Similar to tag for variable we also have tags for running scripts in ejs files i.e. `<%`. Not only this but we have tags for other task too which can be looked [here](https://ejs.co/#docs:~:text=the%20JS%20runtime.-,Tags,-%3C%25%20%27Scriptlet%27%20tag).



## Running code inside ejs template

Similar to creating variables inside html file we can also add script using `<%` tag. We need to keep in mind that every bit of script should be in `<% script %>` and no part of html comes inside script tag. For example ***we can't do something like below.***

```ejs
<% if (var >== 3) {
    <h1>Value of var is <%= var %></h1>
} else {
	<h1>Value of var is less than 3 and is: <%= var %></h1>
} %>
```

Here we are wrapping html part inside our `<%` script tag, which is not right. So we have to do it in a way so that we can avoid adding html part to our script.

```ejs
<% if (var >== 3) { %>
    <h1>Value of var is <%= var %></h1> %>
<% } else { %>
	<h1>Value of var is less than 3 and is: <%= var %></h1>
<% } %>
```

***This approach is right because on part of html code is inside ejs script tag and it can only have control flow statements not hard javascript code.***



## Passing data from Webpage to server

In some cases we need to get post request from the client and we have to render our website accordingly. This can be true for applications like notes or todo. Ofcourse we need to have a post request to send data, but we can also create a dynamic list to show data in our html. We don't need to create hard html structure for our notes or todo items. We can create as many as required using scripts of ejs.

**Passing data will be same using post request**

```ejs
<h1>ToDo List<h1>
<form method="post" action="/" type="submit">
    <input type="text" name="item" placeholder="Enter Item" autofocus/> <br />
    <button type="submit">Add Item</button>
</form>
<ul>
	<% EJitems.forEach(item => { %>
	<li><%= item %></li>
	<% }); %>
</ul>
```

Now on pressing `Add Item` button server will receive a post request, where we can add passed item to a array list on server and redirect post request to our root get request.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const parser = require('body-parser');

app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

// To parse url encoded response from post request
app.use(parser.urlencoded({extended: true}));

let items = [];
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    app.render('ejsFileName', {EJitems: items});
});

// to receive data from client
app.post('/', (req, res) => {
    let item = req.body.item;
    items.push(item);
    app.redirect("/");
});
```

In this way we can handle post request using ejs while also rendring the website according to the req made by client.



## Layouts

We can include layout in our ejs files, which can be used on different pages. Think we need same header, footer, nav-bar in all our pages and without using this feature we have to write the same code in every file that's the problem this solves.

```ejs
<!-- File name:- footer.ejs -->
<footer>
	<p>
        Since 2020-2023
    </p>
</footer>
```

```ejs
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <header>
        <title>Something</title>
    </header>
    <body>
        <%- include('some_nav-bar') -%>
        <p>
            This is some webpage.
        </p>
    </body>
    <%- include('footer'); -%>
</html>
```

***Again it will search for these files in views directory unless specifies otherwise***.

We can also have the variables in layout files which will be passed a value through a file which we include it in i.e. If we have a header file(a layout file) with a variable to define `title` of webpage and we want to use that layout file for 2 different web pages i.e. `Home, About` than we will send the variable value from our `Home` and `About` page.

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.render('Home', {pageTitle: "Home"});
});

app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
    res.render('About', {pageTitle: "About"});
});
```

Here we are sending the value for a variable in header file not in Home or About page, but the best part is that as we are including that layout in our both pages we can send values like this which makes things more easier.
