# SQL

Database is used for storing data. A database handle 4 operations quite well to be good **(CRUD)**

1. **C**reate
2. **R**ead
3. **U**pdate
4. **D**estroy

SQL creates a table which can be modified with some basic sql commands.

There is too much to sql which can be explored [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/).



## Creating a Table

The basic structure for creating SQL table is like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
	column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
    ...
    columnN datatype
);
```

There are various datatypes in sql which one can look [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp).

```sql
CREATE TABLE world (
    name STRING,
    area INT,
    population INT
)
```

This structure is also called schema for the datatbase. We can also set a value to ne `Non-Null` and a `Primary key`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
	id INT NOT NULL,
    name STRING,
    genre STRING,
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
```

Here id will act as primary key and will not be null.



## Describe Table

Describe table will return all the information about the table and this only required to run `DESCRIBE table_name`.  **Describe may not work with some editors** so we can use `PRAGMA table_info(table_name)`. 

## Get sql version

`SELECT sqlite_version()` 



## Delete Table/Row

We can delete a table using `DROP`. This can be done using simple `DROP TABLE table_name`.

```sqlite
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP column_name;
```



## Basic Datatype

1. INT => Used for all the whole numbers (can't have decimal values)
2. DECIMAL(A, B) => Will hold decimal values where A represents digits and B represents numbers after decimal point.
3. VARCHAR(L) => Will hold a string of length L.
4. BLOB => **Binary Large Object** or BLOB is used to store Large Binary data.
5. DATE => 'YYYY-MM-DD'
6. TIMESTAMP => 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' 

## Inserting

Inserting will add things into the table and it's basic structure will be like this:- `INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3) (value1, value2, value3)`.



## Read

There are many ways to read data from sql database. One can recieve whole data, data from a single column, data from a particular cell, ordered data etc.

basic syntax is `SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE some_condition`



## Update

This can be used to update a particular column or a complete record. It's basic syntax is `UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, column3 = value3, ... WHERE some_condition`.



## Modify Columns/ALTER

We can modify the columns in sql database like Adding new column or updating the previous one. **Adding a column Syntax**: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD new_column_name datatype`

```sqlite
ALTER TABLE employees ADD salary INT DEFAULT 0;
```

To delete a column from the table we can use `ALTER TABLE table_name DROP column_name.`



**SOMETIMES COMMANDS WORKS ON SOME DATABASES AND SOMETIMES NOT**. Some database management systems using sql have their own implementation of things which can be useful but may not work with other databases like in MySQL you are allowed to add a foreign key with ALTER but in sqlite it is not allowed. In SQLite you have to recreate the database to add a foreign key in your database.

But in MySQL you can just use ALTER with ADD like

```mysql
ALTER TABLE employee
ADD FOREIGN KEY (employee.branch_id)
REFERENCES branch(branch_id);
```

but to achieve same with sqlite we had to recreate the database



## Delete

Basic Syntax of Delete `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition` This will delete all the values filled in entire row.

## Foreign Keys and Inner Joints

Foreign keys are used when we have a relational database. It is very common to have a relational database considering it's needs in real world. Consider below scenario of a Library.

1. You have a students table with student's id, name, address, email.
2. A books table containing book's id, name ,genre, author, publish year.
3. A table for issueing books containing transaction_id, student_id, book_id, date.

In 3rd table there are 2 relations. 

1. between student's id with students table
2. between book's id with books table.

To make these relations simple we use foreign keys.

**Students table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
	student_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    name STRING,
    address STRING, 
    email STRING
);
```

**Books table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
	id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    name STRING,
    genre STRING, 
    author STRING,
    published INTEGER
);
```

Now we will create a 3rd table which will be having relationships with both other tables.

**Transaction table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions(
	transaction_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    issued_to INTEGER,
    book_id INTEGER,
    issue_date STRING,
    /* Specify Foreign Key*/
    FOREIGN KEY(issued_to) REFERENCES students(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY(book_id) REFERENCES books(id)
);
```

**Inner Joins** are useful when we want to look at the data from all the linked tables in a single table and this can be done with keyword `INNER JOIN`

**Inner Join on Transaction table**

```sql
SELECT transaction_id, students.name, student.email, books.name, issue_date
FROM transactions ((
INNER JOIN students ON transactions.issued_to = students.student_id)
INNER JOIN books ON transactions.book_id = books.id);
```



## Constraints

1. **NOT NULL** => To set a field non-null in the table.
2. **UNIQUE** => No cell in particular column will have similar value.
3. **DEFAULT** => Default is used if no value for that particular cell is passed. To use DEFAULT we need to set a default value for it. `Name CHARVAR(20) DEFAULT 'ANONYMOUSE'.`
4. **AUTO_INCREMENT** => It will automatically increment value in a given cell from previous cell.
5. **ON DELETE SET NULL** => will set the value to null when cell is deleted.
5. **ON DELETE CASCADE** => will remove all the rows which contain the element set to cascade as foreign key. This should be used when a foreign key is set as primary key.



## Basic Queries

**ORDER BY** is used to get result in a specific order

```sql
SELECT student.id, student.name
FROM student
ORDER BY student.name DESC, student.id;
```

**LIMIT **is used to limit the result size of the query

```sql
SELECT student.id, student.name
FROM student
LIMIT 2;
```

**WHERE** is used for filtering.

```sql
SELECT student.id, student.name
FROM student
WHERE student.id < 4
```

**WHERE with IN** is used for finding a value from a group of values

```sql
SELECT student.id, student.name
FROM student
WHERE student.name IN ("Aaron", "Martin", "Bob");
```

**AS** => This will name the column head as forename and surname instead of firstname and lastname.

```sqlite
SELECT firstname AS forename, lastname AS surname FROM employees;
```

**DISTINCT** is used to print all the unique values from a given colum

```sqlite
SELECT DISTINCT firstname
FROM employee;
```



## Functions

1. **COUNT **will return the number of elements those are matched with supplied argument.

   ```sqlite
   SELECT COUNT(emp_id)
   FROM employee
   WHERE age > 23;
   ```

2. **AVG/SUM** is used to return the average/sum salary of a particular group

   ```sqlite
   -- To get the average
   SELECT AVG(salary)
   FROM employee;
   
   -- To get the sum
   SELECT SUM(salary)
   FROM employee;
   ```

3. **Rank** is used to calculate the rank of a particular value from a list of values using a particular column. Like think of Ranking India on the basis of Literacy rate (table contains literacy rate column). For this we need to merge 2 sql commands. 1st one for getting the rank of the countries and second one for filtering India out of it.

   ```sqlite
   -- This query will add ranks to all the elements of table
   SELECT name, literacy, RANK() (
   	ORDER BY literacy DESC
   ) FROM Countries
   
   -- This query will filter the India from the list
   SELECT * FROM database_with_rank WHERE Country = 'India'
   
   -- Now combine both queries
   SELECT * FROM (
   	SELECT name, literacy, RANK() (
       	ORDER BY literacy DESC
       ) FROM Countries
   ) WHERE name = 'India'
   ```

4. **GROUP BY** is used to Filter the **Count** or output by a particular column. This can be useful if we want to get the GDP of world by continent

   ```sqlite
   SELECT region, SUM(`GDP (USD)`)
   FROM countries
   GROUP BY region;
   ```



## WildCards

1. **%** => This is a wild card and is similar to * in regex expressions.
2. **_** => Wild card for a single character.

## Comparison Operators

<table>
    <tr>
    	<th>Operator Function</th>
        <th>Operator Symbol</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<td>more/less than</td>
        <td>&gt/&lt</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<td>more/less than equal</td>
        <td>&ge;/&le;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<td>Not Sign</td>
        <td>&lt&gt</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<td>Boolean Operators</td>
        <td>AND, OR</td>
    </tr>
</table>
